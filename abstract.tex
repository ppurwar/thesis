\chapter*{Abstract}
The task of image segmentation has been solved with great accuracy using different methods for last few years. The solution has evolved from semi-automatic methods to automatic methods with the evolution of Convoloutional Neural Networks(CNN). Recently, Fully-convolutional networks are able to segment images with high accuracy and high speed using full images instead of classifying each pixel. This speeds up the task of segmentation especially for huge images in case electron microscopic data.
\par The only limitation with use of Fully-convolutional neural networks is need of huge training data for training these networks. We need a large amount of images and full annotations to train neural network.

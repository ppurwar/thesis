Ideas related to coupling DNN and VIP:
	
	1. Variational layer at last (after CNN) with neurons for different regularisation parameter, lamda 
		Shall be easy to train, no change backpropagation
	
	2. As first layer: Output of VIP as an input to CNN

	3. Using CNN for generating soft mask and bounding box around object(for shape priors)

	4. Trying to learn mapping between fluoroscent images and non-fluoroscent images - photons produces and effect on cell physiology



Improving/enhancing current pipeline:
	
	1. one more iteration of RF output using one-time segmented image
	
	2. multi-class segmentation

	3. use of wulff shapes

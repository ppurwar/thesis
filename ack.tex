\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to acknowledge the support of my Semester Thesis advisor Dr. Gregory Paul, Post-Doc. at Computer Vision Laboratory at ETH. He consistently steered me in the right direction whenever he thought I needed it. I would sincerely thank Denis Samuylov, who helped with implementation and coding at each step of my thesis.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to acknowledge the support of my Master Thesis advisor Dr. Gregory Paul, Post-Doc. at Computer Vision Laboratory at ETH. I would like to thank Jordi Pont-Tuset for steering me in right direction whenever I got stuck. I would sincerely thank Denis Samuylov and Christoph Mayer, who helped with implementation and coding at each step of my thesis.
